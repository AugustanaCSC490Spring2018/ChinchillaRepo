# Chinchilla Chat

Chinchilla Chat is a chat app for LGBTQ+ students at Augustana College to chat in a pseudonymous way.

## How To Use the App

### Signing Up

Users must sign up with an @augustana.edu email and verify their accounts before they can use the app. This is an anti-spam measure preventing one user from creating multiple accounts.

The username can be any alphanumeric string that has not yet been claimed. Be aware that while usernames are not used in the app in a case-sensitive way, they will be displayed in the form they were initially entered.

The email address must be an @augustana.edu email.

Passwords must be sufficiently complex. This is not easily defined, but as we know, [common password rules don't necessarily make the best passwords](https://xkcd.com/936/ "xkcd: Password Strength"). We implement extremely simple complexity rules that assume a brute-force attack with no consideration for more clever attacks like dictionary attacks. Please choose your password well. Even if it passes our requirements, it may not be a strong password.

After you sign up, we will send you an email to verify your address. Please follow the email verification link. You will not be allowed to use this service until you have verified your account.

### Starting a Chat

If you want to start a chat with some users, you can go to My Chats (from the homepage) then click New Chat. This will open a screen allowing you to type in the usernames of the users to be included in the chat.

If you want to start a chat with a random user, you can click the Chat Now! button. Currently this does not have a mechanism for retrying after chat creation fails (e.g. if you are blocked by the randomly selected user), so just manually retry if it fails.

### Leaving a Chat

From the My Chats screen, if you long-press a chat's name, an option will be provided to leave the chat. For continuity, your messages will still be included in the chat, but you will no longer have access to the chat.

### Blocking Users

Blocking users can be accomplished through the Blocked Users screen, accessible through the hamburger menu in the upper-right corner of the screen. This screen shows the users you have blocked. By tapping on a user's name, you can access the option to unblock them. By clicking the Block New User button at the bottom of the screen, you can enter a new username to block.

Blocking users will prevent them from starting new chats with you. Blocking a user will not prevent them from continuing to contact you through existing chats, so if you want to prevent that, please consider leaving your chats with them.
